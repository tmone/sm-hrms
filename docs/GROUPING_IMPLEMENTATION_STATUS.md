# Grouping Implementation Status

## Last Session Summary (2025-05-25)

### What Was Completed:
1. **Implemented Detection Grouping by Person ID**
   - Added view toggle buttons (Grouped/Individual) in videos/detail.html
   - Backend properly groups detections by person_id in hr_management/blueprints/videos.py
   - Each group contains: person_id, detections list, total_detections, confidence_avg, first_seen, last_seen

2. **Fixed All Template Errors for Grouped View**
   - Fixed confidence calculation errors (lines 686-701, 765-781)
   - Fixed person tracks display (lines 709-739)
   - Fixed table iteration to handle both grouped and individual views (lines 1055-1150)
   - All "dict object has no attribute" errors resolved

3. **Previous Fixes Still Working:**
   - GPU video processing enabled
   - Larger PERSON-XXXX labels in videos
   - H.264 codec for browser compatibility
   - No bounding box overlay when clicking detections
   - Person ID format always shows as PERSON-XXXX

### Current State:
- Template syntax is valid (verified with Jinja2)
- Grouped view should display detections grouped by person identity
- Individual view shows all detections in chronological order
- Both views use the same detection data, just organized differently

### Next Steps When Resuming:
1. Test the grouped view in browser to ensure it displays correctly
2. Verify clicking on grouped person expands to show all their detections
3. Check that navigation to specific detections still works in grouped view
4. Ensure confidence averages calculate correctly for each person group
5. Test switching between grouped/individual views maintains functionality

### Files Modified:
- `/mnt/d/sm-hrm/templates/videos/detail.html` - Fixed all template errors
- `/mnt/d/sm-hrm/hr_management/blueprints/videos.py` - Added grouping logic

### Known Issues to Address:
- None currently identified, but browser testing needed

### Important Context:
- User requested: "Can we grouping the list by identity code?"
- Implementation groups all detections by person_id (e.g., all PERSON-0043 detections together)
- Expandable UI shows summary for each person with ability to see individual detections
