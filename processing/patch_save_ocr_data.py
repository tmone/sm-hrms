OCR Data Saving Status

Good news! OCR data saving is now fully integrated into the video processing workflow.
No patches are needed - OCR extraction and saving happens automatically.

When a video is processed:
1. OCR data is extracted during GPU/CPU processing
2. The data is saved to the video record (location, date, time)
3. All detections are updated with attendance information
4. Data appears in attendance reports
